  <p>Beautiful is better than ugly.<p>
  <p>Explicit is better than implicit.
  <p>Simple is better than complex.
  <p>Complex is better than complicated.
  <p>Flat is better than nested.
  <p>Sparse is better than dense.
  <p>Readability counts.
  <p>Special cases aren’t special enough to break the rules.
  <p>Although practicality beats purity.
  <p>Errors should never pass silently.
  <p>Unless explicitly silenced.
  <p>In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
  <p>There should be one — and preferably only one — obvious way to do it.
  <p>Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you’re Dutch.
  <p>Now is better than never.
  <p>Although never is often better than *right* now.
  <p>If the implementation is hard to explain, it’s a bad idea.
  <p>If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
  <p>Namespaces are one honking great idea — let’s do more of those!<p>
